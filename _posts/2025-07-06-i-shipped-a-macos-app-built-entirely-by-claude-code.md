I was just about to publish a writeup like this for my iOS app, [Fog & Fern](https://fogandfern.app), but he beat me to it! It's a well-written article and I agree with all the points. It sounds like he is a seasoned iOS/Mac developer, which will provide an interesting contrast to my amateur attempt.

> I recently shipped Context, a native macOS app for debugging MCP servers. The goal was to build a useful developer tool that feels at home on the platform, powered by Apple's SwiftUI framework. I've been building software for the Mac since 2008, but this time was different: Context was almost 100% built by Claude Code1. There is still skill and iteration involved in helping Claude build software, but of the 20,000 lines of code in this project, I estimate that I wrote less than 1,000 lines by hand2.

> This is a long post explaining my journey, how I chose my tools, what those tools are good at and bad at (for now), and how you can leverage them to maximize the quality of your generated code output, especially if you're building a native app like I am.
